<h2>Web hover select</h2>
<h3>A chrome extension to select and numerical datapoint element so that the data point can then be tracked</h3>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>I want to track the number of views of one of my blog posts, I simply open the extension, use the html selector to select the tag containing the data I would like to track. I can then use the extension to set a goal for this data point and it will be tracked for me automatically.</p>
